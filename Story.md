# My Story

Once upon a time there was a dog called Fido who was a project manager.  Fido always liked to ensure his team of cats were fully employed.  One day he was very excited to be called in on a new project ...
On this new project, Fido had come across a particular task he had not encountered, so he called upon his friend, Mr. Burns.
